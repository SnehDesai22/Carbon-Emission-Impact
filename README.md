# Carbon Emission Impact Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the impact of varying CO₂ levels on specific environmental or economic factors using data science techniques.
It uses statistical and machine learning approaches to uncover trends, correlations, and predictive insights.

## 🛠️ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for CO₂ datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Predictive modeling to estimate the impact of changing CO₂ levels
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Carbon_Emission_Impact.ipynb** — Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis
- **data/** — Directory to store datasets (not included here)
- **plots/** — Generated visualizations and charts

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** — Historical CO₂ level data sourced from publicly available databases.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** — Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — Identifying trends, seasonal variations, and anomalies.
4. **Modeling** — Applying machine learning techniques to predict and quantify impacts.
5. **Evaluation** — Using statistical and ML metrics to validate predictions.

## 📦 Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` folder.
3. Open `Carbon_Emission_Impact.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## 📈 Results
The analysis highlights how fluctuations in CO₂ levels correlate with target variables, providing insights for policy-making, environmental strategy, or business decisions.
